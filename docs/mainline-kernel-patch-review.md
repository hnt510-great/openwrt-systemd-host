# Review of the 6.18 patch stack against Linux 7.3

Reviewed 2026-10-24. The current 481 source patches and all existing ported-patch
hashes match the generation-30 baseline. No incoming source-patch changes were
found. The review found three concrete optional-feature problems; the complete
6.18 stack is not a drop-in Linux 7.3 patch stack.

All three affected options are disabled in the validated generation-30 kernel.
This review changes the audit metadata and documentation, not kernel patches,
signed APKs, published snapshots, or router state.

## Findings

### P2: MAP-E/IPv6 tunnel port fails compilation when enabled

`pending-7.3/666-Add-support-for-MAP-E-FMRs-mesh-mode.patch` changes `HASH()`
from two arguments to one. Linux 7.3 has two additional wildcard-address lookup
calls that the port leaves as `HASH(&any, local)` and `HASH(remote, &any)`.
Both calls are in the final prepared `net/ipv6/ip6_tunnel.c`.

A targeted compilation of that actual source against an isolated copy of the
packaged generation-30 SDK fails at lines 155 and 168 with
`too many arguments to function 'HASH'`. The helper is defined at line 77.
The normal x86 build did not compile this file because
`CONFIG_IPV6_TUNNEL` is unset.

The lookup/bucket logic needs rebasing for Linux 7.3's separate wildcard paths;
updating only the helper declaration is insufficient. Validate both wildcard
cases and MAP-E matching when fixing the port. Native IPv6 networking does not
require this optional tunnel driver and is unaffected by this finding.

### P2: Quectel RM500Q-AE PCI binding was incorrectly omitted

`backport-6.18/935-v7.3-bus-mhi-host-pci_generic-Add-Quectel-RM500Q-AE-support.patch`
was classified as upstream from its filename's version prefix. The v7.3 tree
does not contain its subsystem binding for vendor/device `17cb:0306`, subsystem
`17cb:5002`.

The carried `pending-7.3/936-...` patch creates the dedicated
`mhi_quectel_rm500q_info` configuration, but the final PCI table has no
`driver_data` reference to it. That identifier occurs only in its definition.
The modem would therefore match the generic SDX55 entry instead of the intended
Quectel configuration. The original patch explains that the generic QMI channel
layout does not work with this firmware's MBIM interface.

The audit now marks patch 935 `needs-port`. Restore the specific PCI binding
while reconciling the 935/936 series to avoid duplicate configuration structures.
`CONFIG_MHI_BUS_PCI_GENERIC` is unset in generation 30.

### P2: DMA-BUF heap drivers are omitted by an inherited Makefile change

`hack-7.3/904-debloat_dma_buf.patch` rewrites the heap directory's rules from
`obj-$(CONFIG_DMABUF_HEAPS_SYSTEM/CMA)` to `dma-buf-objs-$(...)`. That directory
does not define a composite target consuming those variables. Its parent still
descends into `heaps/` as an ordinary Kbuild directory.

Using the actual Linux 7.3 `scripts/Makefile.build`, with both heap options
enabled, produces an empty `heaps/built-in.a` command. An isolated control using
the upstream `obj-*` rules schedules both `system_heap.o` and `cma_heap.o`.
This defect is inherited from the 6.18 patch; it was not introduced solely by
the 7.3 rebase.

Keep the heap objects in that directory's normal `obj-*` lists and validate
their enabled configuration. `CONFIG_DMABUF_HEAPS` is unset in generation 30;
the enabled DMA-BUF core and sync-file support are separate from these heaps.

## Patch accounting and provenance

The corrected disposition of the 481 source patches is:

| Disposition | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Already upstream or equivalent in 7.3 | 192 |
| Carried through patch refresh | 251 |
| Carried through manual merging/rebasing | 35 |
| Superseded by upstream changes | 2 |
| Omitted binding requiring a port | 1 |

The 286 carried patches include the optional-feature findings above. The
additional nfnetlink compatibility patch makes 287 currently applied patches.
All 287 were reapplied to the verified Linux 7.3 source archive with zero fuzz
during this review. Application success does not establish correctness for
every configuration, as the targeted tunnel compile demonstrates.

Upstream history was checked against the canonical v7.3 tag, whose annotated
tag object is `091b06388b117fefdcb63336ac09956a4914b961` and release commit is
`c03c1a14507dfaf8b856c2608f9ac216021fc222`. Kernel.org and the maintainer's GitHub
repository advertised the same tag. A filtered history fetch supplied 95,809
ancestor commits from the selected date range.

For the original 193 upstream classifications:

- 151 patch-header commit IDs were present in that ancestry.
- Another 39 had corresponding upstream commit subjects. Their primary-source
  commit patches were fetched: 30 have identical added/deleted lines; the other
  nine differ through LTS API adaptations, protocol numbering, whitespace,
  maintainer entries, or drivers omitted from the older branch. Those differences
  were inspected rather than treating the patch filename as proof.
- The ath12k binding cleanup and netfilter dependency cleanup pass exact
  zero-fuzz reverse-application checks against the prepared 7.3 source.
- Quectel patch 935 lacked the required binding and is the corrected exception.

The two superseded omissions remain justified. Patch 699's output-interface
fallback addresses the older forward-path API; 7.3 refuses offload when discovery
fails and explicitly assigns the successful path's output interface. Patch 812's
PCI race involved `pci_sysfs_init()` and `pci_create_sysfs_dev_files()`, neither
of which remains in 7.3's PCI sysfs implementation.

The previously corrected bridge BPDU netlink bound, flowtable destination
validation adaptation, standalone nfnetlink module, kallsyms changes, and r8169
LED naming were also inspected. No additional defect was identified in those
paths by this review. The existing full build and VM receipts remain evidence
for the selected x86 configuration, not every optional driver or architecture.

## Evidence and limits

Private review evidence is retained at
`/srv/openwrt-validation/openwrt-mainline-20261024-084724/patch-review-20261024T063814Z/`.
It includes the complete inventory, upstream ancestry and change comparisons,
the isolated SDK compile failure, the actual Kbuild dry-run/control logs, the
missing PCI-reference check, and the repeated zero-fuzz result.

The audit registry links each finding to its source patch. The kernel patch
files and generation-30 artifact hashes remain unchanged. These findings need
fixes and configuration-specific tests before those optional features are
advertised as supported. No physical hardware test, installation, publication,
or reboot was performed as part of this review.
